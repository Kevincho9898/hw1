Changed the speed of circles in line 53 and 54
in line 40 I muted splice and added push command which creates a cool spaz effect,although I couldn't figure out the challenge question

Answer to question 7
I performed linear operation when I was drawing a comic book with my friends in middle school.3 of us sat in a line, 1st one drew the guide lines and form, second one drew the outlines, and third one filled in the color. It seemed like a very efficient way of producing quick drawings.
